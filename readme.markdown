# UpFuckr by [Matt Katz](http://www.morelightmorelight.com)

UpFuckr is a fuckflickr uploader for Android. Typically you wouldn't launch the program, you'd just browse your gallery, select images, and share them to your fuckflickr installation.
When launched, UpFuckr will either prompt you to fill out a configuration for your fuckflickr install or it will give you a screen with a big fat upload button.

*Please* try it out and test it.  I'm writing this to scratch my itch, but feel free to let me know how it could be better.
I've already got some ideas for [UpFuckr's 0.2 Release](http://mattkatz.github.com/UpFuckr/bugs/html/release-0.2.html) but feel free to submit ideas and issues via email, or just clone the project, add your issues to the ditz issues and sennd a push request.

It's all a bit rough right now, but that's how it starts.
